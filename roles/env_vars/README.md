=========

This role generates Windows Environment variables on demand.

The variables that are generated by default are at `env_vars/defaults/main.yml`, at `machine` level, and they can be overriden in any playbook.


Requirements
------------

A Windows host, tested in:
- `Windows Server 2019`

Role Variables
--------------

Default variable:
```
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: dev 
```

Dependencies
------------

No dependancies.

Example Playbook
----------------

Run the role with the default vars:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - env_vars

Override the variables (all the variables are expected to be inside `variables` list):

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: env_vars
           vars:
             variables:
               - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: dev
